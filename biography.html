			Tim Bergling (8 September 1989 – 20 April 2018), better known by his stage name Avicii, was a Swedish musician, DJ, remixer and record producer. Bergling began his career at age 16 posting his remixes in online forums of electronic music, which led him to sign his first record label deal. He rose to prominence in 2011 with his breakthrough single "Levels". His debut studio album, True (2013), featured electronic music blended with elements of several music genres and received generally positive reviews from music critics. It peaked within the top ten in more than fifteen countries and topped the Australian, Swedish, Danish and United States dance charts. It was supported by the lead single "Wake Me Up", which topped most music markets in Europe and reached number four in the United States. In 2015 he released his second studio album, Stories, and in 2017 he released an EP titled Avīci (01). In 2016 he retired from touring due to health issues.His catalogue of music also included the singles "I Could Be the One" with Nicky Romero, "You Make Me", "X You", "Hey Brother", "Addicted to You", "The Days", "The Nights", "Waiting for Love", "Without You" and "Lonely Together". Bergling was nominated for a Grammy Award for his work on "Sunshine" with David Guetta in 2012[9] and his track "Levels" in 2013. Several music publications credit Bergling as among the DJs who ushered electronic music into Top 40 radio in the early 2010s.Bergling died on 20 April 2018 in Muscat, Oman, at the age of 28. Six days later, his family stated in an open letter that he had suffered from severe stress and mental-health issues for a number of years.[12] The letter was widely interpreted to imply that the manner of his death was suicide.[13][14] On 1 May, it was reported that his death was a suicide by self-inflicted injuries that led to blood loss.

		<div>Bergling's early work was deep house and progressive house, usually based on a four-chord structure, sub-bass and a non-complex synth melody. His debut studio album True featured a blending of music genres, including folktronica. While making the album, Bergling wanted to fuse the electronic music genre with soul, funk, blues, folk and country, as he felt that EDM had become too focused on "dirty drops". Its first single, "Wake Me Up", is a folk music crossover, which, as noted by a The Observer writer, "tapped into the market potential of mixing EDM and country, a template many artists have since recreated". A Variety editor commented that Bergling's "distinct sound" was comprised by "soaring synths and keening melodies". Musicians such as Kygo, Skrillex, Diplo, Martin Garrix and Cheat Codes have cited him as a source of inspiration.</div>
